"It was always a dream of mine to have an agency that was all mine. There are so few creative agencies founded by women. I want to see more of them." - Jessica Walsh

It was Jessica Walsh's personal Instagram page that first caught my eye. Very colourful posts with a retro touch. I find the colours, compositions and elements in the photos very inspiring. The agency &Welsh also has fun branding projects, often with a retro element. I find it a very interesting style.
