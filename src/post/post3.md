Hashmukh Kerai is a Motion Graphic Designer and 3D Illustrator. He works as a freelancer in East London. He started his creative career in Film and Production, but then found his love for Motion Graphics and Design. He always had a real passion for moving images and loved to make art that cannot always be made in the physical world. The idea of creating something that is impossible in reality has been at the forefront of his work. This is also what attracts my attention. He makes very nice, modern and sometimes unrealistic (3D) images.
