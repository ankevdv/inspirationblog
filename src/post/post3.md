Hashmukh Kerai is a Motion Graphic Designer and 3D Illustrator working as a freelancer in east London. He originally started up his creative career in Film and Production, but then followed up his love for VFX mainly in Motion Graphics and Design. He had always had a real passion for moving imagery and loved creating art that canâ€™t always be made in the physical world. The notion of creating something that is impossible in reality has been at the forefront of his work.
