Ju Schnee is an illustrator and visual artist based in Berlin. She creates digital illustrations, motion designs, 3D installations and murals. Ju combines geometric shapes with different media. She studied Information Design (BA) and Communication (MA) in Austria and moved to Berlin in 2017. Since 2020 she has her own studio.

"I am in love with shapes, colors and textures. Bauhaus, Memphis, Japanese Graphic Design and Surrealism were the most formative movements for my work. That’s why I work mostly with abstract and vibrant elements. For me it’s magical to tell a story just with abstract elements and special textures. But most important: I want to spread joy. Without joy all my work means nothing.“ - Ju Schnee

What I find very inspiring about Ju Schnee's work is the colours and energy of her work. I find it interesting how she uses geometric shapes in different ways.
