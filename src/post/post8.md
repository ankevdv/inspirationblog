Studio Caro is the creative agency of artist Caroline Vermeir. She is a freelance visual artist from Antwerp. She makes digital illustrations and 3D designs. She also draws weekly portraits for the newspaper De Morgen.

I discovered Studio Caro through Twitter. I find her portraits really breathtaking. I could look at them for hours. A few weeks ago I bought an Ipad and I am trying out Procreate. Studio Caro creates all her portraits in Procreate. I really like how realistic she can draw with it.  Hopefully I will also become that good one day :)
