My name is Anke, I am a young digital creative person with a passion for communication and design. In June 2019 I obtained my degree in Communication Management, Commercial Communication. During this course I learned how to develop campaigns based on the needs of the customer. The visual aspect of communication interested me enormously and that is why in September 2019 I started a new adventure, a shortened course Graphic and Digital Media, Crossmedia Design.

I like to develop, design and adapt visuals and layouts. My passion for web design became even greater as a result of this education. Not only did I learn HTML, CSS and Javascript, but I was also able to give my creativity free rein during the Wordpress lessons. I am currently studying 11ty for the Advanced front-end coding course. On this site, created with 11ty, I share my inspiration as a designer.
